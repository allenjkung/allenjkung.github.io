		Why Create This Website?
		</p>
		<p class="hi">
		The question I am answering is what is the line that defines ethical hacking?
		Ethical hacking is to used describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help indentify potential threats on a computer or network[1].
		The infomation that is obtained from hacking is then used to better the organization's security. 
		The conflict with defining the line of ethical hacking is that there is a grey area. 
		Hackers can be people who prey on unsupecting victims, people who defend the internet from those with malicious intent, people who are vigilantes or curious minds. 
		There needs to be a line that defines ethical hacking because there are people who are wrongly accused or punished for hacking ethically and people who are accused for actions that are not defined as hacking.
		</p>
		<p class="hi">
		If it is possible to make ethical hacking black and white, it will allow case to case concerns about hacking more clear and people will be able to experiment and research with hacking without the fear of accusation.

				<p class="hi">Martin McKeay is a security expert who works for Akamai Technologies.
				McKeay works under the Information Secuirty Industry in 1997.
				He started his career in security by blogging and then hosting a podcast in 2003.
				He used blogging to test his ideas of security and to improve his theories.
				<br><br>
				During the interview, McKeay display a lot of knowledge on the topic of ethical hacking and his opinions on what needs to be changed.
				He explained that there are many recent cyber security events and cases around the world with problems that consist of unsure accusation to major changes.
				His concern with the CFAA effects on ethical hacking is that the CFAA has the ability to accuse people who downloaded a file on the internet.
				The problem is that downloading a file is not hacking.
				<br><br>
				The interview with McKeay shows the flaws in the CFAA and that defining the line for ethical hacking is not possible because of how the large the grey is.

			<h2>Poll Responses</h2>
			<p class="pollans">
			Hacking that would be considered for what society feels is the greater good at that time.<br><br>
			In a sense it is stress testing a computer to find faults in it to improve the system overall.
			This will help companies protect against people who want to hack their system to do harm or other criminal activities.<br><br>
			Ethical hacking is hacking for the greater good of the majority.<br><br>
			Yes.<br><br>
			It doesn't exist. But I guess in today's society it would be test systems' security by legally hacking into them.<br><br>
			Ethical hacking is a person with hacking that does it for the good perspective such as hacking a corporation to identify weak points.<br><br>
			The action of ethical hacking is penetrating systems that are susceptible to real hacking and allowing companies to secure those exploits in their systems.<br><br>
			Hacking to prevent bad.<br><br>
			A Hacker that hacks his own company to find security vulnerbilities that a malicious hacker could potentially exploit.<br><br>
			Hacking is when you invade someone privacy illegally.<br><br>
			Ethical hacking is hacking but for helping people.<br><br>
			Idk<br><br>
			Hacking but for good.<br><br>

<section class="Conclusion">
	<h1>The Future</h1>
	<p class="future">After everything, the conflict with defining the line of ethical hacking is that the grey area is too large to be defined as black and white.
	The range of people that can be accused under the CFAA is too general and broad.
	To better the law that surrounds the CFAA, there needs to be a reform where judgement is based off the integrity of the judge and not the words of the bill.
	The severity of the punishment needs to be decided case by case so that the punishment is just.
	For every era, technology will constantly expand and change so the laws that surround ethical hacking needs to adapt and change as well.
